        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of H.E Prof. John Evans Atta Mills' life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> 1944</strong> - born July 21, 1944 in Tarkwa, Ghana.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1967</strong> - After secondary school, Mills studied law at the University of Ghana (LL.B., 1967), 
			the London School of Economics and Political Science (LL.M., 1968), and the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, 
			completing his Ph.D. dissertation (1971) on taxation and economic development. On his return to Ghana, he taught law at the University of Ghana, 
			where he remained for some 25 years. He also served on numerous boards and committees, occasionally acted as a visiting professor in the United 
			States and the Netherlands, and published extensively on taxation, including the Report of the Tax Review Commission, Ghana (1977).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1988</strong> - Mills eventually left academia to establish a distinguished career in public service. 
			Appointed in 1988 as acting commissioner of Ghana’s Internal Revenue Service, he eventually became (1993) substantive commissioner. 
			He stood as Pres. Jerry Rawlings’s running mate under the banner of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the 1996 elections. 
			They were victorious, and Mills took office on January 7, 1997, as vice president, 
			a post he held until 2001. Mills was the NDC candidate for the presidency in the 2000 and 2004 elections, 
			but he was defeated by John Kofi Agyekum Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party (NPP).            
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - During his first two presidential campaigns, Mills had been roundly criticized for statements that if elected he would consult 
			with Rawlings. When Mills was again the NDC candidate for the presidency in 2008, he distanced himself from his former mentor and campaigned on the 
			slogan “I believe in Ghana.” Self-described as a social democrat who believed in the concept of social welfare espoused by Kwame Nkrumah 
			(independent Ghana’s first leader), Mills embraced a political platform that was more comprehensive and less divisive than that of either Nkrumah or 
			Rawlings. Mills’s persistence and determination paid off when he won the 2008 presidential poll, defeating the NPP’s candidate, 
			Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, by a narrow margin (50.23–49.77 percent). The election marked the second time in Ghana’s history that 
			one legitimately elected leader had handed over power to another. It demonstrated that, after an era of coups and dictatorship (1966–92), 
			democracy had been established and reinforced in the western African country, despite occasional eruptions of ethnic conflict and political tension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - On January 7, 2009, Mills was officially sworn in as president of Ghana. After his inauguration he set about to improve 
			the socioeconomic situation of ordinary Ghanaians, who ranked among the world’s poorest people, with an average daily income of $2.32, 
			a 60 percent literacy rate, and 10 percent unemployment despite the country’s potentially valuable natural resources. In his first State of 
			the Nation address on February 19, 2009, Mills announced an austerity program, promising steep cuts in government spending, beginning with 
			cutbacks in wages and a review of the government’s recent order of two presidential jets. He also instituted policies to eliminate four 
			cabinet ministries and reduced the size of the presidential convoy. Mills presided over the commencement of the country’s first commercial 
			oil production in late 2010 and promised that government would spend the newfound oil revenue responsibly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - In July 2011 the NDC selected Mills to be the party’s candidate in the 2012 presidential elections; 
			however, he died five months before the elections were to be held.
          </li>
          <li><strong>2012</strong> - dies at the age of 68.</li>
